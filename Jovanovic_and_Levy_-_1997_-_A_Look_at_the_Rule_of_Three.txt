A justification for the Rule of Three. If you observe no successes in
n trials, what is a confidence interval for p? (If all successes,
define success as failure and take 1-end result.)

By Poisson distribution: Exact CI is (0, -ln(.05)/n).

By Binomial distribution: Exact CI is (0, 1 - .05^(1/n)).

Rule of Three is 3/n. Adjusted Rule of Three is 3/(n+1).

For n > 100, all roughly equivalent. For small sample sizes, 3/(n+1)
is slightly preferred.
