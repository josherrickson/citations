tldr: If two CI's don't overlap, you can reject the null that point
estimates are the same. If they don't overlap, you need to test the
hypothesis that x1 - x2 = 0.


If viewing two confidence intervals for two point estimates, it is a
common practice to see whether the confidence intervals overlap;
failure to overlap provides evidence that the two points differ
statistically.

Call this method the "overlap method" and call hypothesis testing (x1
- x2) = 0 as the "standard method".

If the overlap method rejects, then the standard method rejects.
(If the two CI's don't overlap, a hypothesis test will find a
significant difference.)

If the overlap method fails to reject, then the standard method may
reject or not reject.
(If the two CI's reject, we don't know what a hypothesis test will
do.)

Two CI's can overlap and a hypothesis test still find them
signficant. This is more likely when the standard error of each point
is simialr (e.g. the amount of overlap for which the hypothesis test
fails to reject is largest if the CI's are of equal width).


A different approach - reject if neither CI contains the other point
estimate - has issues the other way. No overlap here does not imply
significance in the hypothesis test.


Correlation between the point estimates makes the problem
worse. (Above was assuming independence.)
