Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the
exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the
generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error
distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated
distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However,
this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model.

E.g. normality is not important!
