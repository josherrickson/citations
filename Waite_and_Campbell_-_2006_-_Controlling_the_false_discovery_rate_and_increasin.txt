Familywise error rate (FWER) - Rank p-values, reject first at .05/m,
reject second at .05/(m-1), third at .05/(m-2), etc.

Argument against FWER is that it increases Type II error as
significance depends on the number of other tests done. Also suffer
from reduced power.

Instead, control for false discovery rate (FDR) using
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure.

Bonferroni - 95% certainty there are NO false discoveries.

FDR/BH - At most 5% of signifant findings are false discoveries. (If
further citation needed, Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995.) If a large
number of tests, P(At least one false discovery) increases, but only
5% of those discoveries will be false.

Methodologies:

Order all p-values from low to high. Say there are m total p-values.

Bonferroni FWER: Reject lowest p-value at .05/m. Reject second lowest
p-value at .05/(m-1). Etc. Reject highest p-value at .05/(m-[m-1]) =
.05.

BH FDR: Reject lower p-value at 1*.05/m. Reject second lowest p-value
at 2*.05/m. Reject third lowest p-value at 3*.05/m. Etc. Reject
highest p-value at m*.05/m = .05.
