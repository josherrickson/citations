Provides a discussion of what to use mixed models and when to use fixed effects models.

The big argument for fixed effects is omitted variable bias and
endogeneity at level 2 does not impact level 1 estimates. Also a lesser argument that
<30 clusters is bad for mixed model.

They also suggest a "within-between mixed model", e.g. group-mean centering predictors and also including group means as predictors. E.g. something like

y_ij = ... + beta*(x_ij - xbar_j) + alpha*xbar_j

This splits within and between completely.
