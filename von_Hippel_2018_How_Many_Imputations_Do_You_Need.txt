Rebuttal of the typical "m = 5 imputations" recommendation.

The m = 5 (or as this paper puts it, 2-10) is sufficient for
efficienct estimation of point estimation, not for standard error of
point estimate. Suggests m = 200 for sample sizes where this
reasonable.

Introduces a two-stage procedure.

1) Perform a "pilot" MI on 5-20 imputations. Using the fraction of
   missing information [1 - var(point estimate | complete
   data)/var(point estimate | M imputations)], calculate how many
   total imputations are needed.  Specifically, use a "conservative"
   fraction of missing information, based on CI (so larger M in pilot
   will lead to more precision in M for follow-up.)

2) Use the new M to run the imputation.

Fraction of missing information is NOT % of missing data, however, you
can get rough estimates. The rule of thumb I get out of this is that

For little missing information, use m = 50.
For moderate missing information, use m = 200.
For large missing information, use m = 400.


The quadratic rule is 200*(fraction of missing information)^2.

Implemented in Stata via `how_many_imputations`:

```
webuse mheart1s0, clear
mi impute regress bmi attack smokes age female hsgrad, replace add(10)
mi estimate: logit attack bmi smokes age female hsgrad
how_many_imputations, cv_se(.01)
mi impute regress bmi attack smokes age female hsgrad, add(`r(add_M)')
mi estimate: logit attack bmi smokes age female hsgrad
```
